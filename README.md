# cig

The coolest C compiler in town... he even smokes.  
Built by following Nora Sandler's "Writing a C Compiler" book using Zig.

## Usage
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Supports Linux and MacOS. Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64.

To run on a C source file, you can use the below command:

```bash
zig build run -- source.c

```
Below commands are available to test separate compiler stages:
- `--lex`: stop at lexing
- `--parse`: stop at parsing
- `--codegen`: stop at codegen
- `-S`: emit assembly but do not assemble

## Other stuff
Next on the list is the end of Chapter 1:
- Assembly emission
- Reference assembly AST from zig compiler
