# cig

The coolest C compiler in town... he even smokes.  
Built by following Nora Sandler's "Writing a C Compiler" book and using Zig.

## Usage
To run on a C source file, you can use the below command:

```bash
zig build run -- source.c

```

I don't know how the build system works properly yet, but once I do this will be nicer.

## Other stuff
Next on the list:
- Argument parsing & flags
- Lexing
